Data distribution: 70%/15%/15% --> 80k examples total --> 56k/12k/12k


Steps:
1 - Create custom dataset (DONE)
2 - Create dataset instance (DONE) 
3 - Create Noise Reduction Filter (get one from github - add credit and reference in the code)
4 - Work on preprocessing dataset

5 - Once all images have been preprocessed in the dataloader and split into smaller images, work on network that will get these smaller images.
