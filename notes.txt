Data distribution: 70%/15%/15% --> 80k examples total --> 56k/12k/12k


Steps:
1 - Create custom dataset (DONE)
2 - Create dataset instance (DONE) 
3 - Create Noise Reduction Filter (DONE)
4 - Work on preprocessing dataset (DONE)
5 - Once all images have been preprocessed in the dataloader and split into smaller images, work on network that will get these smaller images. (in progress)

To ask later:
- How does the model know which outputs correspond to the right ones? For example, I have a list with 35 different characters, and the model does not know that. I did not specify to the model which those are. Do I have to? Do I just let the model figure it out itself?

- If the model has to know the possible output classes, how do I implement this in the code?
